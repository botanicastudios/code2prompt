# Code2Prompt

This project, Code2Prompt, is a versatile codebase analysis tool designed to create prompts and generate Readme files. The tool traverses a given codebase, focusing mostly on JavaScript files, creating a context prompt out of it. The unique feature of Code2Prompt is its ability to communicate with the OpenAI API, providing the ability for automated creation of high-quality documentation using AI.

## Features

1. Thorough codebase analysis: Traverse the given codebase, focusing on specific file extensions, principally JavaScript. It includes the ability to ignore certain patterns.
2. Context Prompt generation: Convert the analyzed code into a context prompt ready for asking questions to an AI model.
3. Readme Generation: Leverage the power of AI to create high-quality documentation, such as Readme files, from the generated context prompts.
4. Templates: Use predefined or custom templates for generating prompts and documentation.
5. Enforced Schema: Include a predefined or custom schema for ensuring the consistency and quality of AI responses.
6. Integrates with OpenAI API: The ability to communicate with and use an OpenAI model for advanced response generations.

## Installation

To install Code2Prompt, clone the repository and install the needed dependencies with the following steps:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/code2prompt.git
    cd code2prompt
    npm install
```

## Usage Examples

To generate a context prompt or ask the OpenAI model a question, follow the steps below:

```javascript
    const Code2Prompt = require('./index');
    const { z } = require('zod');
    require('dotenv').config();
    
    const options = {
        path: '.',
        extensions: ["js"],
        template: 'templates/default.hbs',
        ignore: ["**/node_modules/**"],
        OPENAI_KEY: process.env.OPENAI_KEY 
    };
    const code2Prompt = new Code2Prompt(options);
    // To generate a context prompt.
    const prompt = await code2Prompt.generateContextPrompt();
    // To ask a question with optional schema enforcement
    const response = await code2Prompt.request("Question?", z.object({...}));
    console.log(response.data);
```

## Configuration Options

The constructor function for Code2Prompt takes a options object as an argument. The following properties can be defined in this object:

* path: The path to begin traversing the codebase.
* extensions: An array of file extensions to focus on during traversal.
* template: A handlebars.js template to use for converting the codebase into a context prompt.
* ignore: An array of Glob patterns to ignore during traversal.
* OPENAI_KEY: An optional OpenAI API key for communicating with the OpenAI API when using the 'request' method.
* schema: An optional predefined Zod schema for enforcing the structure of AI responses.
